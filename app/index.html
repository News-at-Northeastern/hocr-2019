                <h3>The Course</h3>
                <p>Overall, the race course stretches three miles, or 4828 meters, up the Charles River between Boston and Cambridge.</p>
            </section>
            <section id='start'>
                <h3>The Start Line</h3>
                <p>The race begins adjacent to Boston University's DeWolfe Boathouse, near the Charles River Basin. Rowers quickly pass under the BU Bridge, as well as a railroad trestle, on their way to the course's wide first turn.</p>

            <section id='river'>
                <h3>River Street and Western Avenue</h3>
                <p>Kown as the "Powerhouse Stretch," boats reach top speeds as they pass under the bridges carrying River Street and Western Avenue.</p>
            </section>
            <section id='weeks'>
                <h3>Weeks Footbridge and Anderson Memorial Bridge</h3>
                <p>The halfway point, and the course's sharpest turns, come between these two bridges, where collisions and close calls between boats are common. At the two-mile mark, rowers hug the Boston shore around the course's biggest curve.</p>
            </section>
            <section id='eliot'>
                <h3>Eliot Bridge</h3>
                <p>Following that curve, rowers prepare for the home stretch, and spectators enjoy some of the best views on the river (especially at the Belmont Hill/Winsor dock on the Cambridge side).</p>
            </section>
            <section id='finish'>
                <h3>Herter Park Finish Line</h3>
                <p>At the three-mile mark, rowers triumphantly cross the finish line between Herter Park and the Mt. Auburn Cemetery, just before Northeastern's Henderson Boathouse. In 2017, UC-Berkeley's men's Championship Eights crew set a course record when they arrived here from the BU Bridge in 13 minutes and 27 seconds.</p>
